# flask_todo
## Overview
Create a basic CRUD application using Python and Flask.

## How to Run
Install dependencies  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  
Run app  
`python app.py`

## Ideas for future functionality  
- Don't let user add empty tasks: if box is empty, clicking "add task" will not add a task.

## Note
I accidentally pushed pycache and then remembered to add it to gitignore after the fact.
